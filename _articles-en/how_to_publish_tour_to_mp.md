## **Step 1**

Follow the instructions in the article [*"Creating a Tour"*]({% link _articles-en/creating_a_tour.md %}).

## **Step 2**

At the last step in "Publish" turn on the checkbox "Publish in marketplace".

When you create a tour, the checkbox "Publish in marketplace" is turned off by default. And while itâ€™s turned on, the tour is published to "Marketplace".

## **Step 3**

Setup an additional information such as:
- type of a tour;
- category;
- languages;
- interest;
- intensities;
- skill level;
- age;
- accessibility;
- suitability.
