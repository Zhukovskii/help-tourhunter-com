E-mail of a new User is checked with data in "Personal Info". If there is a match, then appears an error "User with this e-mail is already invited to the current company".
If there is no match, then after you click on "+ Create Password" appears two fields "Password" and "Confirm password", so you can create a password for a new user.

### **Step 4**

Assign a role.

By default in drop-down "Role" displayed value "Please select". More about roles and how to create and assign them you can get to know in the article [*"Creating a role"*]({% link _articles-en/creating_a_role.md %}).
