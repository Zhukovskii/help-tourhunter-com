### **Step 4**

Choose “Pick-up List Type”:
- "Fixed pick-up time" - interval time option "НН:ММ - НН:ММ" (e.g., "12:00 - 13:00");
- "Allow customer to choose a pick-up time"; 
- "Fixed time before tour starts" - a difference between the start time of the tour and tour duration.

Customers or Agents are allowed to change pick-up time only if you set “Allow Customer to choose a pick-up time” in “Pick-up List Type” dropdown. Suppliers and employees can always change the pick-up time.

### **Step 5**

Choose “Pick-up Options”:
- "Pick-up time by Area";
- "Pick-up time by Location".

You can’t save the pick-up list without area (if you choose "Pick-up time by Area"). If you try to save the pick-up list without area, an error will be displayed "Must be added at least one area.". But if the checkbox "Allow customer to request other Area" is turned on, then you can save the pick-up list without area. 

Same with locations, you can’t save the pick-up list without location (if you choose "Pick-up time by Location"). If you try to save the pick-up list without location, an error will be displayed "Must be added at least one location.". And if the checkbox "Allow customer to request other location" is turned on, you can save the pick-up list without a location.

### **Step 6**

Add pick-up list to a session/schedule on tour setup step in “Schedule”.

How to create schedules describes in the article [*“Creating a tour schedules”*]({% link _articles-en/creating_a_tour_schedules.md %}).

### **Step 7**
