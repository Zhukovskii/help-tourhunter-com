You can manage your billings in the “Top menu > Billing & Payments” section.

“Billing & Payments” page contains information about the current subscription and payment status for Suppliers and Agents if you click on the “Manage” button next to the company’s name.

### **Current Bill**

This tab shows information about subscription, account balance and date of the next payment:
- “Current bill amount” - subscription amount;
- “Billing date” - date of the next payment. Also, it’s the last day of the subscription, after which the company is blocked.

“Current bill amount” is considered equal to $0.00 if the user has an endless trial subscription.
